Binary classification has four possible types of results:

True negatives: correctly predicted negatives (zeros)
True positives: correctly predicted positives (ones)
False negatives: incorrectly predicted negatives (zeros)
False positives: incorrectly predicted positives (ones)

### Next step 28 July

- CLassification of having the transportation?

- finding the point of interests (where speed = 0)

---

fix the speed

0. clean the data

1. Create a target variable, a sustainablilty score

2. logistic regression

3. **independent variable:** distance, speed and elevation

4. [0 1] if 1 => cable or not
   3 categories 0 and 1 (cable or sth else)

5. compare the different algorithms (SVM, multi logistic regression ...)

about 10 slides

1. lit review
2. a couple for data
3. a couple for ML algorithm
4. results and conclusion
