\chapter{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
With the rapid expansion of cities and the escalating worries regarding the sustainable use of our natural resources, the quest for achieving transportation systems that are not only efficient but also eco-friendly has garnered significant attention and become an urgent global challenge. 
Sustainable mobility, often referred to as sustainable transportation, aims to develop and implement strategies that promote the efficient movement of people and goods while minimizing negative environmental and social impacts. 
% Machine learning, a field of artificial intelligence, has emerged as a promising approach to addressing the complexities inherent in sustainable mobility by leveraging data-driven insights and advanced computational algorithms.

Furthermore, machine learning, a field of artificial intelligence, involves the development and application of computational models that can automatically learn and improve from data without explicit programming. By analyzing large and diverse datasets, machine learning algorithms can identify patterns, make predictions, and gain valuable insights that aid decision-making processes. In the context of sustainable mobility, machine learning can provide innovative solutions to optimize transportation systems, improve accessibility, and minimize environmental impact.

Optimizing transportation systems through machine learning involves the application of data analytics to enhance operational efficiency, reduce congestion, and improve the overall performance of transportation networks. By processing large volumes of data collected from sources such as traffic sensors, GPS devices, and social media platforms, machine learning algorithms can generate real-time traffic predictions, optimize routing, and dynamically adapt transportation services. These advancements lead to improved travel experiences, reduced travel times, and more efficient allocation of resources.

Accessibility is a key aspect of sustainable mobility, aiming to ensure that transportation services are available and equitable for all individuals, regardless of their physical abilities, income levels, or geographic location. Machine learning algorithms can help address accessibility challenges by analyzing data on travel demand, demographics, and infrastructure characteristics. This enables the identification of underserved areas, optimization of transit routes, and the design of transportation services that cater to the needs of diverse populations.

Environmental sustainability is another critical dimension of sustainable mobility. Transportation accounts for a significant portion of global greenhouse gas emissions and is a major contributor to air pollution. Machine learning can play a crucial role in minimizing the environmental impact of transportation by developing predictive models that estimate emissions, optimize energy consumption, and facilitate the integration of clean and renewable energy sources. Additionally, machine learning techniques can aid in the design of eco-routing algorithms, which suggest the most environmentally friendly travel routes based on real-time data.

In summary, the combination of machine learning and sustainable mobility presents a promising framework to address the complex challenges faced by transportation systems. By harnessing the power of machine learning algorithms, transportation stakeholders can optimize operations, improve accessibility, and mitigate environmental impact. As the demand for sustainable and efficient mobility solutions continues to grow, machine learning can provide valuable insights and tools to shape the future of transportation, leading to more sustainable, accessible, and environmentally friendly mobility systems.
